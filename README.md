Used Xammp,and PHPmyadmin.
Database: contact
Table: contact 
(see contact.sql)

I was able to implement every functions:
1. Add contact (index.php,insert.php)
   I was not able to implement add an image completely, though the user can add an image. It will not be stored on the server
2. View all contacts(contacts.php)
3. Edit and delete a contact(contacts.php,edit.php,delete.php)
4. Sort the contacts (contacts.php)
   They can sort by ascending or descending. Please note that the user will have to refresh the contacts.php page,if they want to sort an already sorted data.
5. Look for a specific contact based on anything e. name, email etc. (contact.php, search.php)
