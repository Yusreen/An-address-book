This project shows how a website can mimick an address book.

I used Xammp,and PHPmyadmin.
Database: contact
Table: contact 
(see contact.sql)

The functions implemented are as followed:

1. Add contact (index.php,insert.php)
  For now, the image will not be saved.
2. View all contacts(contacts.php)
3. Edit and delete a contact(contacts.php,edit.php,delete.php)
4. Sort the contacts (contacts.php)
   They can sort by ascending or descending. Please note that the user will have to refresh the contacts.php page,if they want to sort an already sorted data.
5. Look for a specific contact based on anything e. name, email etc. (contact.php, search.php)

The UI is as follows:
